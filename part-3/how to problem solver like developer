Whenever John encounter a problem:
1. Don't jumps at the problem without much thinking 
2. Don't implements solution in an unstructured way
3. Don't gets stressed out when things don't work
4. Don't is proud to research solutions
=> stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at problem without a plan
=> take a very logical and  rational  approach

=> use my 4-step framework to solve any problem:

1). make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right question to get a clear picture of the problem.
vi dụ: 
project manager: "We need a function that reverse whatever we pass  into it".? "tôi cần một hàm mà lưu được bất cứ cái gì tôi đưa vào
 1. What does "Whatever" even mean in this context? What should be reverse.(Bất cứ cái gì trong ngữ cảnh này là cái gi? Cái cần lưu trữ là gì?)
 answer: only strings, number, and array make sense to reserve;
 2. what to do if something else is pass in?
 3. What should be returned? Should it always be a string, or should the type  be the same  as pass it?
 4. How to regconize whether the argument is a number, a string, or array?
 5. How to reserve  a number, a string, and an array? 

2). Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
    Check if argument is a number, a string, or an array
    implement reversing a nunber
    implement reversing a string
    implement reversing an array
    return reverse value

3) Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to
    how to check if a value is a number, string, an array in javascript
    how to reverse a number, string, an array in javascript

4) For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code
    example: 
    function reverse(value)
        if value type !string  || !number ||! array
            return value
        
        if value type  == string 
            return string
        if value type == number 
            return number 
        if value type == array
            return array
        
        return reverse value
